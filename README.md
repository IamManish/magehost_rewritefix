## JeroenVermeulen_RewriteFix

**We are sorry but we cannot offer customer support for this extension, and it is provided "as-is" for free. We use it at a number of big shops and it works well.**

Due to bugs in Magento, once an rewrite URL ends with -[number] you get more and more rewrite URLs to the same target. The number gets higher and higher. Indexing gets slower and slower.

This extension is a workaround for this problem.

Requires Magento 1.7.0.2 or greater.
